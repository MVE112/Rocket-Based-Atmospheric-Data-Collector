# Rocket-Based-Atmospheric-Data-Collector
Project Lab 2
The projectâ€™s purpose is to use a model rocket that will be able to gather atmospheric data using a raspberry pi and successfully use maria database to keep that gathered data stored. To collect the atmospheric data a BME280 will be used. The BME280 can collect humidity, pressure, altitude, and temperature. The project also requires calculation of launch force so a H3LIS33IDL accelerometer will be used as it can calculate the acceleration which then can be used to calculate the launch force. The main programing language used is python 3 as it is the required language and it will be used to program the raspberry pi, the BME280, and the H#LIS33IDL. To set up the database SQL will be used to add information to the maria database. An extra hardware part not required by the project is, as of the writing of this paper, the Optimus 2.0 GPS which is used for locating the rocket after launch.
